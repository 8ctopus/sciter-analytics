# sciter in-app analytics

This is a [sciter.js](https://sciter.com/) in-app analytics experiment.
The idea is to be able to monitor what users do within the application.

## demo

- git clone the repository
- run `install.bat` to download the latest sciter binaries and the sciter package manager
- install packages `php spm.phar install`
- run `scapp.bat`
- to refresh the app after changes to the html/css click `F5`
